Hey all! I’m Nikaash and I just graduated from UC Berkeley with degrees in Data Science and Economics. As one of the lead TAs for Berkeley's introductory data science course, I have taught data techniques to hundreds of students at all different skill levels. I’ve lived in Boulder my entire life, and love exercising outdoors (pickleball has been my latest endeavor!). I’m super excited about the curriculum that we put together for you all — you’re not going to find any of this content in a high school course.

Hey all! I’m Nikaash and I just graduated from UC Berkeley with degrees in Data Science and Economics. I’m really excited to share with you a sample of some of the data techniques and skills I learned in undergrad. I’ve lived in Boulder my entire life, and love exercising outdoors (pickleball has been my latest endeavor!). I’m super excited about the curriculum that we put together for you all — you’re not going to find any of this content in a high school course.

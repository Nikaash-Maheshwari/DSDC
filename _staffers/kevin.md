Nice of you to drop by! I’m Caleb, a Duke graduate with degrees in Computer Science and Environmental Science. Data science has been at the heart of my academic career for four years, and I’m thrilled at the chance to pass on some key skills to all of you that will be useful no matter what field you go into. I am a Boulder native and when I’m not coding you can find me deep in the outdoors. Feel free to reach out with any questions!

P.S. Nikaash and I offer a $20 standing bounty for any pickleball doubles team that can beat us in a best of three.
